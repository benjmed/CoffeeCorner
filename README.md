# Coffee Corner Application
## Overview
The following repo contains java application for Charlene's Coffee Corner, implemented as a POC for a technical interview.

## Requirements
Recently, Charlene decided to open her very own little coffee shop on a busy street corner.
Being the careful entrepreneur, she decided to start off with a limited offering, with the option to expand her choice of products, as business goes
Her Offering
- Coffee (small, medium, large) 2.50 CHF, 3.00 CHF, 3.50 CHF
- Bacon Roll 4.50 CHF
- Freshly squeezed orange juice (0.25l) 3.95 CHF
  Extras:
- Extra milk 0.30 CHF
- Foamed milk 0.50 CHF
- Special roast coffee 0.90 CHF
  Bonus Program
  Charlene's idea is to attract as many regularâ€˜s as possible to have a steady turnaround.
  She decides to offer a customer stamp card, where every 5th beverage is for free.
  If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free.
  Objective:
  Write a simple program whose output is formatted like a receipt you would receive at a supermarket.
  The input to the program is a list of products the shopper wants to purchase (large coffee with extra milk, small coffee with special roast, bacon roll, orange juice

## Assumption
- If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free, the first extra added to the list will be for free

## Business logic
- We save the available products in a products.json file
- We process the products.json file and convert the items into business objects of type Product
- The main application shows the client the list of available products, each product has an identifier


-  [0] EXIT menu

-  1
-  2
-  3
-  4
-  5
-  6
-  7
-  8
- if the user chooses option 0, the program is exited
- Otherwise, the user enters their selection with the indicated format
- We create the Order business object that contains the products selected by the customer
- The processOrder method is invoked that calculates the free beverages, free extras, number of beverages, number of snacks, total amount, discounts and amount to pay.
- The printInvoice method is invoked to display the invoice
